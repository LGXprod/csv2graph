# csv2graph

## Purpose

The purpose of the csv2graph CLI tool is to enable developers, data scientists and the like to quickly migrate csv data into a medium that can ingested by a graph databases or tools.

I am currently aiming to develop options for exporting data to the following graph mediums:

- RDF (Turtle) (Added, future revisions to come)
- D2RQ Mapping Language

- RedisGraph Bulk Loader CSVs
